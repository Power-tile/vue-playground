# Usage Methods
## General
After cloning the repository, open a branch and name it what you prefer. Then commence alternations.

## Playground
In the ```playground-blank/``` folder is a blank Vue HTML+JS project (without template). You can copy the folder into the ```user-playgrounds``` folder and rename your new folder your branch name, e.g. ```user-playgrounds/power-tile```. If you do not want to share your playground with others, you could clone the ```playground-blank/``` folder to the root folder and rename the new folder ```self-playground/```. **Do not** change the ```.ignore``` file.

## Challenges
In the ```challenges/``` folder, every challenge is in its own folder. ```demo.gif``` is the screen recording of the intended result; ```description.md``` is the description of the challenge (including purpose, warnings, related skills, etc.). 

Example:
In the folder ```challenges/competency-grader/```, ```challenges/competency-grader/demo-1.gif``` is the first level challenge result; ```challenges/competency-grader/description.md``` contains the description, ```challenges/competency-grader/answer-1``` is the first level challenge answer code. To start the challenge, follow the instructions in ```description.md```. 
Some challenges will contain a ```template/``` folder, for example, ```challenges/competency-grader/template/```. If this folder exist, clone this folder in the same directory and rename it with your branch name. The ```template``` folder contains the template/data needed to finish the challenge. If not, clone the ```playground-blank/``` folder into the challenge folder and rename it with your branch name, e.g. ```challenges/competency-grader/billy/```.
